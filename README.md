# Praetorian Machine Learning Challenge

This is my code for the solution to a challenge by [Praetorian Cybersecurity Solutions](https://www.praetorian.com/challenges/machine-learning).

From the website:
> The crux of the challenge is to build a classifier that can automatically identify and categorize the instruction set architecture of a random binary blob. Train a machine learning classifier to identify the architecture of a binary blob given a list of possible architectures. We currently support twelve architectures, including: avr, alphaev56, arm, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, sh4, sparc, x86_64, and xtensa.
